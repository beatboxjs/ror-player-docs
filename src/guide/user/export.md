# Export tunes

## Export default tunes/breaks

You can download the default song of a tune or a specific break as MP3. To do so, click the <fa icon="download"></fa> download icon next to the song/break on the tune page.

Note that the MP3 is generated on the spot in the browser, which is why it can take some time. To abort the download, click the <btn variant="primary"><fa icon="times"></fa></btn> cross.


## Export custom songs

You can export and download a [composed song](./compose) as MP3 or WAV. MP3 files take much less space on your hard disk, but take longer to create.

To export the current song, click on <btn><fa icon="cog">Tools</fa></btn> and then <btn variant="item"><fa icon="file-export"></fa> Export MP3</btn> or <btn variant="item"><fa icon="file-export"></fa> Export WAV</btn>.

Note that the MP3/WAV is generated on the spot in the browser, which is why it can take some time. To abort the download, click the <btn variant="primary"><fa icon="times"></fa></btn> cross.
